Eclipse Che is a free and open Java framework for building Web client applications that are beautiful, fast, and modular. Che creates cross-browser applications by combining extensions into a single compiled and optimized application. Extensions are provided by Che and authored by you as Java classes that use GWT libraries. Your extensions are compiled with Che and translated to JavaScript with support for most modern browsers.

Che contains:
* A cloud IDE
* A kernel for loading, managing, and operating extensions authored as plug-ins
* A set of platform APIs for developer microservices (e.g., 'build project')
* Implementations of the APIs for desktop and cloud deployment
* Plug-ins for multiple programming languages, source code systems, builders and runners
* Everrest open source utility for mapping Java to Web Services
* A CLI for interacting with platform APIs
* An Eclipse plug-in for editing, building and running Che projects from within Eclipse
* Developer tooling for building and packaging plug-ins

The IDE is a browser application that has a extensions packaged into it. Extensions make use of the platform APIs and run on the Eclipse Che kernel. The kernel is a servlet-based framework that loads and manages extensions.  The kernel can be run in any servlet container. Tomcat bundling is provided within Che. Tomcat is also included to make startup configuration simpler. 

Che can be installed on any operating system that supports Java 1.7 - desktop, server or cloud, and Maven 3.0.5 or higher. It has been tested on Ubuntu, Linux, MacOS and Windows. Java, GWT, GIN and Javascript are the core technologies used to build Che.

### Clone the Repository & Checkout Latest Stable Branch

```sh
git clone https://github.com/codenvy/sdk.git
cd sdk
git checkout 3.7.1
```

We advise against building the master branch as you may encounter intermediate errors. 

This builds the SDK, which includes our Java and git plug-ins.  If you want to build Che with all known plug-ins, build [github.com/codenvy/assembly-che] (https://github.com/codenvy/assembly-che).

### Build and Run Che
```sh
cd /sdk
mvn clean install
./che.sh [ start | stop ]
```

Che will be available at ```localhost:8080```

### AngularJS Plugin Configuration
This plugin requires npm, Yeoman, bower and Grunt to be installed.

* npm setup guide : https://github.com/npm/npm
npm is bundled with nodejs which can be downloaded from: http://nodejs.org/download/

* Yeoman (and bower / Grunt dependencies can be installed with: npm install -g yo)

### Add Your Extensions to Che
1. Create, build and compile a Che extension into a Java JAR file. [Tutorial is here.] (http://docs.codenvy.com/che/). You can create extension JARs within Che or your favorite IDE. Build extensions in Eclipse gives you super dev mode for Eclipse, which makes incremental compilation fast.

2. Copy the extension's JAR file to ```/assembly-sdk/target/tomcat-ide/ext``` directory of Che.  

3. Execute ```$ ./extInstall.sh``` script. Che will be re-compiled with your extension. This will take a few minutes.

4. Restart Che.
