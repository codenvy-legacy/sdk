The Codenvy SDK is a free and open Java framework for building Web client applications that are beautiful, fast, and modular. The Codenvy IDE is included with the SDK, packaged as a GWT Java application that compiles to optimized JavaScript with support for most modern browsers.

The SDK contains:
* Codenvy IDE
* Codenvy WCP
* Platform APIs
* Commons Utility Libraries
* 15+ Plug-Ins
* Everrest open source utility for mapping Java to Web Services
* Developer tooling for building and packaging plug-ins

The Codenvy IDE is a Web client application that contains a variety of plug-ins, makes use of the platform APIs, and runs on the Codenvy Web Client Platform (WCP).  The WCP is a thin servlet-based framework that loads and manages plug-ins.  The WCP can be run in any servlet container.  The build process for the SDK combines all of these components into an assembly readied for Tomcat.  Tomcat is also included in the distribution to make startup configuration simpler. 

The Codenvy SDK can be installed on any operating system that supports Java 1.7 - desktop, server or cloud. It has been extensively tested on Ubuntu, Linux, MacOS and Windows.  Java, GWT, GIN and Javascript are the core technologies used to build the SDK.

The Codenvy SDK is licensed on a proprietary Codenvy license. We will provide an open license for the SDK once it has hit a stabilization point.

### Build the Project
```sh
cd /sdk
mvn clean install
```

### Run the Codenvy SDK
```sh
./codenvy_sdk [start|stop]
```

The hosted IDE will be available at ```localhost:8080```

### AngularJS Configuration

In order to be able to use this plugin, some of tools needs to be available on the system.

These tools include : npm and Yeoman stack (with bower and Grunt)

* npm setup guide : https://github.com/npm/npm
npm is bundled with nodejs which can be downloaded from there : http://nodejs.org/download/


* Yeoman (and dependencies can be installed with the command line : npm install -g yo)
   more details on http://yeoman.io/gettingstarted.html

### Add Your Extensions (Plug-Ins) to the SDK

1. Package your extension as a JAR either offline or in the IDE.  If in the IDE, go to **Project** menu and build your extension. After the build is finished you will see a link in the Output console that points to a location to download your artifacts.  

2. Copy the JAR artifact from the previous step to ```/ext``` directory of the SDK.  

3. Execute ```extInstall``` script in the root of the SDK to load this plug-in. The project will be re-compiled.

4. Restart the SDK to have the changes take affect permanently.

You may need to empty browser’s cache (if you haven’t set appropriate HTTP headers) to see the extension.
