                        Codenvy Platform SDK
                       ------------------------
                       Build Your Own Cloud IDE


=============
Requirements
=============

 *  Java Platform, Standard Edition 7 Development Kit (JDK 7) or later;
 *  Apache Maven version 3 or later.


===========
Installing
===========

1. Download and install JDK 7.

1.1. Download JDK, release version 7 or later, from
     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.

1.2. Install JDK according to the instructions included with the release.

2. Download and install Apache Maven.

2.1. Download Apache Maven, release version 3 or later, from
     http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.

2.2. Install Apache Maven according to the instructions included with the release.

3. Make sure JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your JRE.
   Make sure M2_HOME is set to the location of your Maven.

4. Download and unpack Codenvy Platform SDK.

4.1. Download a binary distribution of Codenvy Platform SDK.

4.2. Unpack the archive where you would like to store the binaries.
     A directory called "codenvy-sdk-[version]" will be created.

5. Codenvy SDK requires some libraries in order to launch Codenvy extensions that you develop.
   You should copy these libraries to your local Maven repository.

5.1. In Tomcat root, execute the following command:

On *nix:
      ./install.sh

This script will find your local Maven repository and copy libs there.
It will also download and unpack another Tomcat which is used as runtime for apps and extensions launched in Codenvy SDK.

===================
Running & Stopping
===================

1. In order to launch a Codenvy Platform SDK, go to bin directory and start Tomcat:

On *nix:
      ./catalina.sh start

After launching, Codenvy Platform SDK application will be available at http://localhost:8080/

2. To stop a Codenvy Platform SDK application, execute the following command:

On *nix:
      ./catalina.sh stop
      
=========================================================
How to configure oAuth with GitHub and SSH key management
=========================================================

* Go to GitHub.com and login to your account

* In account Settings, find Applications menu on the left

* Click register a new application (if you don't have any)

* Enter application name

* Homepage URL should be

=====================
http://localhost:8080
=====================

* Authorization callback URL should be

=======================================================
http://localhost:8080/api/oauth/callback
=======================================================

* Having registered or updated the app, you will have Client ID and Client Secret in the top right corner of the application page on GitHub

* Copy those values to a file located in conf folder of the SDK Tomcat package - /conf/github_client_secrets.json

* By default, values for Client ID and Client Secret are filled with "***". You need to replace those with real values obtained from GitHub application settings

===========================
Local Storage Configuration
===========================

Codenvy SDK provides configuration file 'codenvy-api-configuration.properties' located at webapps/api/WEB-INF/classes/codenvy with a set of parameters having default values. To persist local configuration settings each time a new SDK version is downloaded, this file should be copied to a permanent location, and a new local environment variable should be added:

export CODENVY_LOCAL_CONF_DIR="[path to a location where config file is stored]", for example:

export CODENVY_LOCAL_CONF_DIR="/home/eugene/.codenvy"

=================================================
Configure local storage for projects and SSH keys
=================================================

The vast majority of values do not need any changes. In order to store projects and SSH keys in a specified location (and thus avoid their deletion each time a user receives updates) the following default paths should be changed:

1. For local SSH key storage:

ssh.key_store_location=${catalina.base}/temp/ssh


2. For local projects storage:

vfs.local.fs_root_dir=${catalina.base}/temp/fs-root
vfs.local.fs_index_root_dir=${catalina.base}/temp/fs-root

Just replace default values with your local paths. For example:

ssh.key_store_location=/home/codenvy/SDK/.ssh
vfs.local.fs_root_dir=/home/codenvy/SDK/.projects
vfs.local.fs_index_root_dir=/home/codenvy/SDK/.projects

===============================================
Contribute 3rd-party extensions to Codenvy IDE
===============================================

1. To contribute 3rd-party extensions to Codenvy IDE, one need to do the following steps:

1.1. Place an appropriate jar-files into "ext" directory.

1.2. Execute the following script:

On *nix:
      ./extInstall.sh

1.3. Restart Codenvy IDE if it is currently running.

=================
Update Extensions
=================

1. Launch extension at Run > Launch Codenvy Extension
2. Click extension URL in the Output console
3. Click Update Extension button in the runner instance
4. The extension will be recompiled which may take around 1 minute
